# About @nodelibraries/ioc

## What is @nodelibraries/ioc?

**@nodelibraries/ioc** is a lightweight, type-safe IoC container designed for Node.js and TypeScript, inspired by .NET Core's dependency injection system. It provides seamless dependency injection with zero dependencies and no decorators required.

Our core philosophy: **precision, clarity, and seamless integration**. We believe dependency injection should be as natural and unobtrusive as possible.

## Philosophy

### 🎯 Precision

Every dependency is resolved with type safety and compile-time guarantees. No runtime surprises, no guesswork.

### 🧹 Clean Code

No decorators, no annotations, no framework lock-in. Your code remains pure and framework-agnostic.

### 🔧 Flexibility

Register services using interfaces, classes, factories, or pre-created values. Choose the approach that fits your needs.

### ⚡ Performance

Lightweight and fast. Minimal overhead, maximum efficiency.
